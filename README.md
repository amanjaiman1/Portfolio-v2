# Portfolio-v2
  Friends, i'm sharing you my portfolio version 2 <br>
  In this current version , i've designed and developed the complete UI from previous version and here i'd shared the complete file with you.
  Download it, run and make this version more awesome, See i do not here to telling you that dont copy it or bla bla but what i want to say that instead of   copying, make changes better from this version. <br>
  Yeah seriously whatever we do, if its done with team workflows then literally better. So i'm finishing my writing here,
> "Just Do Better"
