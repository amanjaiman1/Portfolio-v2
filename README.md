# Portfolio-v2
  Friends, i'm sharing you my portfolio version 2
  In this current version , i've designed and developed the complete UI from previous version and here i'd shared the complete file with you
  you can download it, run and make this version more awesome, See i do not here to telling you that dont copy it or bla bla but what i want to say that instead of   copying, make changes better from this version.
  Yeah seriously whatever we do, if its done with team workflows then literally better. So i'm finishing my writing here,
